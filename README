The app language is 100% Kotlin

How to use it?

First, when the app starts, it is going to ask you for your location permission.
If the permission is guarenteed you are going to get the current weather informations in your „For You“ screen.
You can add a pin on the map by long clicking.
When you click on a pin that you added before you will see the current weather and the city name.
You can search for a city and it will automatically add it to your „Favorites“ Therefore the city must exit in the citylist.json file.
By longclicking you can delete the City and by onlclicking you can open the detailpage in your favorites.
On the map we didn‘t implement the option to delete a marker because it isn‘t user friendly.
At night the view of the detailpage changes automatically.
To refresh the „For You“ page you can swipe upside down to load the new data if this is avabilable.
The app supports also an offline mode which means you can see your cities in the favorites without internet.
To edit a favorite you have to delete the city and add a new one.
In the „Settings“ section you can only enable darkmode. Switiching metrics isn’t implemented yet.

After giving your permission for your location please refresh the „For You“ screen to get the weather for your current location.
When you press the „Floating“ button the icon on the button nav. bar will not change to the Mapview icon, i don’t know why, I guess it is a bug in the Emulator.
When the exection "grpc failed" throughs, please wipe the data from the Emulator.

When the App starts the very first time, the „For You“ page doesn’t show you added pins. Please restart the app here then it should work.
There are a few codeblocks which aren’t deleted. Those ones we don’t use yet but we want to expand the project in near future.
The app supports german and english.
For this app we used Google Pixel 2.
